# Simple-CNN-Pytorch

Image Classification using a simple CNN model

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

## Model

The model used for this project is a simple CNN model with 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the Cross Entropy Loss function.
